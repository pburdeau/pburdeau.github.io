Hi! I'm **Philippine (Phil)**, a researcher focused on methane emissions estimation and
produced gas composition. I build statistical and geospatial models that combine
measurements and inventories to improve estimates across U.S. oil & gas basins.

**News**
- Oct 2025 — Nature Communications decision in principle for our paper on produced gas composition.
- 2025 — Moving to Boston; seeking R&D/TPM roles in climatetech.

**Interests:** methane inventories, intermittency/HMMs, geostatistics, kriging + ML, open data & reproducible science.
