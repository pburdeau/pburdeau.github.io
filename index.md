<p class="dropcap">
I build statistical and geospatial methods that combine measurements and inventories to improve basin‑scale estimates of methane emissions and produced gas composition.

My recent work blends **intermittency/HMMs**, **kriging + non‑linear models**, and **reproducible pipelines**. I’m Boston‑based and open to collaborations at the intersection of emissions, sensing, and geospatial modeling.
