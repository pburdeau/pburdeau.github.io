# Mission

We are in the dawn of a new era of methane science and produced gas composition modeling where statistical learning and geospatial methods are used in real applications to interpret measurements and inventories. At the intersection of data and energy systems, I develop algorithms and workflows that improve basin‑scale estimates and support better climate decisions.
