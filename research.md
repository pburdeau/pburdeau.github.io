# Research

## Produced gas composition maps
Kriging + non-linear modeling to estimate produced gas composition across U.S. basins. Reproducible code and interactive maps forthcoming.

## Intermittent methane emissions (HMMs)
ON/OFF state models with lognormal size processes and explicit detection models for sparse observations; applications to inventories and survey design.
