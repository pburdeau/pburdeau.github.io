### Produced gas composition maps
Combining kriging and a non-linear model to estimate produced gas composition across U.S. basins. Reproducible code and interactive maps forthcoming.

### Intermittent methane emissions (HMMs)
ON/OFF state models with lognormal size processes and explicit detection models to handle sparse observations. Applications to top-down inventories and survey design.
