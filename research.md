### Produced gas composition maps
We combine kriging and non-linear modeling to estimate produced gas composition across U.S. basins.
We release reproducible code and interactive maps.

### Intermittency & HMMs for methane emissions
We develop ON/OFF state-space models with lognormal emission size processes and detection models to handle sparse observations.
